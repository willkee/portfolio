# Hey there! I'm Will.

## Welcome to my Portfolio Repository!

<p>
						I am in the last few weeks of the App Academy Online
						software engineering boot camp. This has been an
						incredible journey in which I have been inspired and
						challenged like never before, in a 1000+ hour curriculum
						over 24 weeks and with an acceptance rate of less than
						5%. The 6 months in this program have only made me more
						passionate about building applications out of code or
						solving problems using technologies such as JavaScript,
						ReactJS/Redux, Express.js, and Python to name a few.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have built four full-stack applications, both
						independently and with a team of three other software
						engineers which have challenged me to use best Git
						workflow practices and utilizing separate branches and
						pull requests through GitHub. My last solo capstone
						project was a camping-themed lightweight clone of
						Airbnb. This project consisted of two full CRUD
						features, an embedded map through Google Maps API (Hi
						Google!), a file upload system leveraging use of Amazon
						Web Services (AWS), and a wealth of error validations
						through Express Validators all to make for a better user
						experience, completed independently within the span of
						two weeks.
					</p>
					<p>
						I hope to bring this passion of coding into my next
						journey after App Academy to work with a
						forward-thinking and innovative company in an industry
						where there is always something new on the horizon, and
						endless opportunities to learn.
